# Data PoC

## OVerview

The Data Proof of Concept focuses on testing the synergy between language models and database systems. 

This system aims to evaluate how well language models can interact with and utilize data stored in databases to provide insightful and contextually relevant responses. The proof of concept involves setting up a test environment where the LLM can query the database, retrieve relevant information, and generate accurate responses based on the stored data. 

This system seeks to explore the potential for enhanced data accessibility and utility, ultimately aiming to improve the overall effectiveness of information retrieval and interaction within database-driven applications.

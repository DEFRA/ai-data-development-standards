# Ministerial Correspondence

## Overview

The Ministerial Correspondence Unit is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline the management and response of documents and communications directed towards ministers. 

This system allows users to upload and store a variety of documents that serve as knowledge repositories for language models. Additionally, users can upload emails and letters received from the public or other stakeholders, which the system processes to generate draft replies. These drafts can be reviewed and adjusted as needed, ensuring that responses are both accurate and contextually appropriate. 

The unit aims to enhance efficiency in handling ministerial correspondence by leveraging advanced language models to automate initial response drafts, thus reducing the administrative burden on staff.

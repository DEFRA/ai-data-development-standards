# IG Log

## Overview

The IG Log is a tool designed to capture, store, and analyze interactions with language models. This proof of concept allows users to manage LLM prompts and responses by organizing them into structured projects, sessions, steps, and threads. Each interaction is logged systematically, enabling in-depth analysis of the LLM's behavior and performance over time. 

This system provides a streamlined interface for tracking the evolution of LLM outputs, facilitating the identification of patterns, inconsistencies, and areas for optimization. By organizing LLM interactions into manageable units, the application enhances the ability to understand, refine, and audit the language model's responses efficiently.

# Feedback Triage

## Overview

The Feedback Triage is a Proof of Concept (PoC) system that transforms user feedback into actionable insights.

This PoC automates processing of user feedback, using LLM to enrich and transform raw user feedback into easily queryable data.

## Features

- Provides dashboard with LLM trend summarisation
- Supports Q&A over triaged data using GraphQL generated by an LLM Agent
- Utilises LLM to triage feedback received from users to:
    - Generate feedback summary
    - Extract its key points
    - Assign a category and subcategory from predetermined ones
    - Mark it `urgent` if necessary

# AI / Data Development Standards

This is a repository of standards and supporting guidance for all developers working within AI and Data.

The purpose of the standards are to ensure that delivery supports the Architecture Vision set out by the programme and better enable developer agility and mobility through consistent patterns and practices.

The guidance provides developers with quick access to resources and processes to best support the standards and delivery.

# AI / Data Development Standards

We use a range of programming languages at Defra because we think using the right tool for the job gives us the best chance of building services that best meet users’ needs. This document does not apply to choosing ‘off the shelf’ software (open source or not).

We focus on using a small number of programming languages for core software development tasks.

This should make it easier for developers to:

- move around the organisation
- develop shared components
- improve their personal development
- master how they operate applications

This is a repository of standards and supporting guidance for all developers working within AI and Data.

The purpose of the standards are to ensure that delivery supports the Architecture Vision set out by the programme and better enable developer agility and mobility through consistent patterns and practices.

The guidance provides developers with quick access to resources and processes to best support the standards and delivery.

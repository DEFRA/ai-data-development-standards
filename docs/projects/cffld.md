# CFFLD Feedback Triage

## Overview

The CFFLD Feedback Triage system is designed to handle and enrich user feedback collected in CSV format. Users upload feedback files, which the system processes using advanced language models to extract and enrich the data. The enriched feedback is then integrated into a knowledge base, allowing for comprehensive querying and question answering. 

This system aims to improve the management of feedback by transforming raw data into actionable insights, facilitating better decision-making and response strategies. By leveraging language models to enhance and structure feedback, the system supports more effective analysis and utilization of user input.
